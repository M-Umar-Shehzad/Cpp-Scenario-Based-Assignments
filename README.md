# C++ Scenario Based Assignment

This repository contains a collection of foundational C++ programs developed for as university assignment. The project focuses on solving scenario-based problems using fundamental programming control structures, including conditional logic, loops, and state-based architecture.

## Project Overview

The assignment consists of 10 distinct problems, each addressing a specific real-world logic scenario. The solutions are implemented in separate source files, demonstrating the practical application of C++ syntax and logic to handle data validation, calculations, and conditional decision-making.

## List of Programs

The following table maps the assignment questions to their corresponding source code files:

| Question | Description | Source File |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q1** | **Employee Salary Calculator:** Calculates a final salary after applying a 12% increment based on user confirmation. | `12_percent_Salary_Increment.cpp` |
| **Q2** | **Circle Circumference:** Calculates the circumference of a circle using the formula 2 * 3.14 * radius. | `radius_of_circle.cpp` |
| **Q3** | **Refrigerator Temperature:** Monitors temperature and determines if it is below, equal to, or above 5 degrees Celsius. | `Temp_Of_Refrigirator.cpp` |
| **Q4** | **Insurance Validity:** Determines insurance validity based on Age, Driving License status, or CNIC availability. | `Validity_of_Insurance.cpp` |
| **Q5** | **Blood Donation Eligibility:** Checks age and weight requirements, then categorizes body temperature (Low, Normal, Fever). | `Eligibility_to_donate_blood.cpp` |
| **Q6** | **Movie Ticket Pricing:** Determines ticket prices based on age groups (Child, Adult, Senior). | `Price_Of_Movie_Ticket.cpp` |
| **Q7** | **Fitness Level Selector:** Validates age and weight, then allows the user to select and display their fitness level via a menu. | `Validity_of_age_and_weight.cpp` |
| **Q8** | **Day of the Week:** Converts an integer input (1-7) into the corresponding day of the week. | `Days_Of_Week.cpp` |
| **Q9** | **Middle Value Finder:** Compares three distinct numbers to identify and display the median value. | `Middle_Value.cpp` |
| **Q10** | **Health Camp Eligibility:** Checks if a candidate meets specific age (18-55) and weight (45kg+) criteria, providing specific feedback. | `Eiligibility_for_health_camp.cpp` |

## Technical Implementation Details

The solutions leverage the following C++ core concepts:

* **Control Structures:** Extensive use of `if-else if-else` statements for decision-making and initial logic flow.
* **Structured State Management:** Strategic use of `switch` statements to handle discrete program states, separating the logic determination from the final output handling.
* **Looping Mechanisms:** Utilization of `while` loops specifically for robust input validation (ensuring non-negative values and correct menu choices).
* **Logical Operators:** Application of `and` / `or` operators to handle complex compound conditions.
