# C++ Scenario-Based Implementations

A centralized repository for C++ solutions focusing on scenario-based problem solving, logic building, and system simulation. 

This collection demonstrates the practical application of C++ programming concepts—ranging from fundamental control structures to  data management systems—to solve simple real-world logic problems and case studies.

## Repository Contents

### 1. [Core Logic & Control Structures](./Assignment_1)
**Focus:** Algorithmic Logic
A collection of 10 distinct scenario implementations addressing specific mathematical and conditional problems.
* **Scenarios Covered:** * Simple Salary & Tax Calculation Logic
    * Simple Geometric Area Computations
    * Simple Grading Algorithms
    * Unit Conversions & Conditional Branching


### 2. [Student Result Management System](./Assignment_2)
**Focus:** System Design & Data Validation
A console-based application designed to manage academic records.
* **Key Features:** Dynamic record handling, rigorous input validation (0-100 range checks), and statistical aggregation (class averages, highest scores).
* **Tech Stack:** C++ Control Flow (`while`, `for`), Conditional Logic ladders.

## Future Scope
This repository is actively maintained and will grow to include:
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Scenarios.
* File Handling Implementations.
* Advanced Data Structure simulations.
